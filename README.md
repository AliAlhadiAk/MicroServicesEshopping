Microservices Application
Overview
This repository contains a microservices application designed to demonstrate the use of various technologies and architectural patterns including Redis, SQL and NoSQL databases, CQRS, MediatR, and Jenkins for CI/CD. The application is structured to showcase how these components can be integrated to build a scalable and maintainable system.

Architecture
Components
Microservices: The application is composed of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain or functionality.
Redis: Used as a distributed cache and for pub/sub messaging.
SQL Database: Relational database used for structured data storage.
NoSQL Database: Non-relational database used for unstructured data.
CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation pattern to separate read and write operations.
MediatR: A library used to implement CQRS by handling commands and queries.
Jenkins: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool used to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
